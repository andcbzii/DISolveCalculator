# DISolveCalculator
**DISOLVE CALCULATOR (Differential and Integral Calculator)**
     This calculator is created primarily to program the formulas of Differential and Integral Calculus. And aims to help
    students in their Calculus Journey.
    
**Introduction**
    As engineering students, we understand that Mathematics is an essential subject that we must study. During our first year in this Computer Engineering program, we took two Mathematics courses: Differential Calculus and Integral Calculus. Being one of the students who find these subjects difficult, we decided to create a calculator that can assist students in differentiation and integration.
  
**Objectives**
Our goal is to provide students with quality education and assistance in Differential and Integral subjects.
Provide them comfortability in finding answers in their Calculus journey.

**SDG Goal:**
SDG4 represents a pledge to "ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all." This goal serves as a fundamental catalyst for driving positive change, underscoring the transformative impact of education in cultivating a sustainable and fair global society.

**Technical Overview:**
Upon running the program, a user will be able to choose what branch of Calculus they want to use. Under Dfferential Calculus, there are Constant Multiple Rule, Product Rule, Quotient Rule, Sum Rule, Power Rule, and Transcendental Rule. While under Integral Calculus, there are simple formula integration. Also, the list of formulas is provided so that students can easily view the formula that is useful in Calculus.
